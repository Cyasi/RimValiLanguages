# Nesi RimVali Translation Mod
Translation Mod of Nesi's RimVali _(https://github.com/NesiTheAvali/RimVali)_ for Rimworld.  
  
This is only for development purposes. Translations will be merged in the main Mod.

## Translation Tipps
- to start just fork the repository, copy one of the language folders and rename it to your language.
- optional: If you are not sure if the current translation is up-to-date with the mainmod, I can recommend this tool: https://github.com/RimWorld-zh/RimTrans. (It is a bit out-dated and files are sorted differently, so be careful.)
- use the translation report ingame, it's just a button on the mainmenu and give warnings and errors whats missing etc. (Make sure to have only RimVali and RimVali Translations enabled in your modlist)
